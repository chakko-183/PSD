Langkah-langkah Umum\n","\n","* Ingest & sampling — ambil sample dataset (mis. 1k baris) untuk eksplorasi awal.\n","\n","* Profiling — statistik dasar: count, unique, min/max, mean, std, percentiles.\n","\n","* Visualisasi awal — hist, boxplot, scatter untuk deteksi pola & outlier.\n","\n","* Quality checks — missing, duplicates, inconsistent formats, range checks.\n","\n","* Data dictionary / metadata — jelaskan tiap kolom: tipe, allowed values, deskripsi.\n","\n","* Lineage & source validation — darimana data? apakah ETL mengubahnya?\n","\n","* Privacy & compliance — PII handling, GDPR/PDPA bila relevan.\n","\n","2. Dimensi Kualitas Data (detail)\n","\n","  * Completeness (kelengkapan): ada missing/null?\n","\n","  * Accuracy (ketepatan): apakah nilai mewakili kenyataan? (sulit verifikasi tanpa sumber eksternal)\n","\n","  * Consistency (konsistensi): format kolom konsisten (tanggal, kode pos), business rules konsisten (ShipDate >= OrderDate)\n","\n","  * Uniqueness: duplicate transactions / order IDs\n","\n","  * Validity: apakah nilai di domain yang valid (mis. Segment ∈ {Consumer, Corporate, Home Office})\n","\n","  * Timeliness: data up-to-date sesuai kebutuhan analisis\n","\n","  * Integrity / Referential: relasi antar tabel (jika ada) valid\n","\n","3. Data Dictionary (contoh ringkas untuk Superstore)\n","\n","  * *Order ID* — string, unik per order (mis. CA-2018-...)\n","\n","  * *Order Date* — date, format (YYYY-MM-DD)\n","\n","  * *Ship Date* — date\n","\n","  * *Ship Mode* — categorical (First Class, Second Class, Standard Class, Same Day)\n","\n","  * *Sales* — numeric (float), total sale amount\n","\n","  * *Quantity* — integer\n","\n","  * *Discount* — numeric (0.0 - 1.0) biasanya percent\n","\n","  * *Profit* — numeric (float)\n","4.
